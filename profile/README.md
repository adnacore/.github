## About

The Ancient DNA Core Unit at the MPI-EVA carries out research that drives the development of new molecular and computational methods for ancient DNA and makes these available to the research groups within the Max Planck Society as a service.

The services currently available include automated DNA extraction, library production, capture, DNA sequencing, and informatic processing of the large and specialized data sets generated in the facility.
